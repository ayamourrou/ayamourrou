👋 Hi, I’m @ayamourrou

👀 I’m interested in Java, Spring Boot, JEE, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced patterns in framework usage and enhancing my full stack development skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that are focused on web development and building robust backend solutions. I'm particularly excited about contributing to projects that benefit from my range of backend to frontend skills.
